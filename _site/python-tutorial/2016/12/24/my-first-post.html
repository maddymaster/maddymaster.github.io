<p>Hello and welcome to my blog.</p>

<p>I will try to teach python to those who are beginners in coding with no coding background or even a CS degree, and to those who have been coding in other languages but want to learn Python.</p>

<p>This is a 100 days plan. Apart from the usual tutorials, there will be milestones, assignments, activities and even programs to code. This requires some serious committment and self dedication. You wont get any certificate out of this but a lasting coding experience.</p>

<p>I am sure you wont be a python programmer in 100 days, nobody can be anything in 100 days. Learning coding is like learning any musical instrument. I dont want to be another trap like thousands of other online tutorials out there who advertise to convert you to a programmer in 40 hours or 100 hours etc.,</p>

<p>You need to come back everyday, try out the code, run into problems, find your way out, get your hands real dirty and only then you will emerge a winner. Learning python has no end, you start once, you keep going. While I am teaching python, I am still learning a lot of it too.</p>

<p>To even teach Python, I need to stay committed. So lets, both commit to learn and teach python to eachother.</p>

<p>“Stay committed to your decisions, but stay flexible in your approach.” - Tony Robbins.</p>

<p>You just got to commit and in 100 days you’ll be writing python like a pro if you simply follow this blog</p>

<p>“If you’re interested, you come up with stories, excuses, reasons, and circumstances about why you can’t or why you won’t. If you’re committed, those go out the window. You just do whatever it takes.”</p>

<p>Although I want do blog about a lot of things; python, django, javascript, nodeJS, Angular2, GoLang, MYSQL, RethinkDB, MongoDB, Express, AWS, Azure, Elastic, Kibana, ML, AI, IoT etc.,, for now, to start with; I intend to cover basic and important tutorials on <code class="highlighter-rouge">Python</code> and then include some advanced versions. I intend to help those who are beginners in programming and also cater to advanced programmers who want to learn Python, JS, and so on.</p>

<p>I practice a teaching method that focuses on Logic and Purpose first and then its application and use. That way we know what and why we are learning a particular lesson and then focus on where it can be applied. This helps understand topics deeper and remember for a long time.</p>

<p>I will also try to provide visuals along with code snippets and I hope to publish two topics every week and be done with Python in the first quarter.</p>

<p>I know this is slow, but, this is all the time I got. Follow my blog topics in the following order. (Some may not exist as I haven’t blogged them yet)</p>
