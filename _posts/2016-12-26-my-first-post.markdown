# Python Tutorial

Hello and welcome to my blog. 

I am just getting started as a part of my 2017 plan. I havent really thought out everything but will share a lot of my experiences around various programming languages, technologies and practices. I take pride in product development, engineering and problem solving

I am starting with teaching Python.

I will also try to provide visuals along with code snippets and I hope to publish two topics every week and be done with Python in the first quarter. 

I know this is slow, but, this is all the time I got. Follow my blog topics in the following order. (Some may not exist as I haven't blogged them yet)

“If you’re interested, you come up with stories, excuses, reasons, and circumstances about why you can’t or why you won’t. If you’re committed, those go out the window. You just do whatever it takes.”
