# Python Tutorial

Hello and welcome to my blog. 

Before I continue on this article, to keep an audience in mind, I decided make the following assumption: 
Whoever you are, whatever you do, if you are on this page, that means that either you want to learn Python or you already are a master of it and want to improve your grip on the language or draw some motivation to write your own tutorial. 

Just to clear out any voices in your head, dont give it any heed, dont self doubt, have an open mind, dont judge anyone including yourself, follow the article and you'll get there. When you learn something new, there will always be some opportunity that will come by, it will find you and help you make something out of it(money, career etc., ) 

The thing is - anybody can learn anything, even Python is no different. I know many non-tech, art, commerce, even doctors who wanted to learn Python, have learnt it, mastered it and have been working as successful developers. If you can commit to what you want to learn, nothing can stop you from learning anything, becoming anything!

“Stay committed to your decisions, but stay flexible in your approach.” - Tony Robbins. 

You just got to commit and in 100 days you'll be writing python like a pro if you simply follow this blog

“If you’re interested, you come up with stories, excuses, reasons, and circumstances about why you can’t or why you won’t. If you’re committed, those go out the window. You just do whatever it takes.”

Although I want do blog about a lot of things; python, django, javascript, nodeJS, Angular2, GoLang, MYSQL, RethinkDB, MongoDB, Express, AWS, Azure, Elastic, Kibana, ML, AI, IoT etc.,, for now, to start with; I intend to cover basic and important tutorials on `Python` and then include some advanced versions. I intend to help those who are beginners in programming and also cater to advanced programmers who want to learn Python, JS, and so on.

I practice a teaching method that focuses on Logic and Purpose first and then its application and use. That way we know what and why we are learning a particular lesson and then focus on where it can be applied. This helps understand topics deeper and remember for a long time.

I will also try to provide visuals along with code snippets and I hope to publish two topics every week and be done with Python in the first quarter. 

I know this is slow, but, this is all the time I got. Follow my blog topics in the following order. (Some may not exist as I haven't blogged them yet)
