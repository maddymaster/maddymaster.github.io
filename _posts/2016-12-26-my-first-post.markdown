# Python Tutorial

Hello and welcome to my blog. I want to first cover some important tutorials on `python` basics and then include some advanced versions. I intend to help those who are beginners in programming and also cater to advanced programmers who want to learn Python.

I practice a teaching method that focuses on Logic and Purpose first and then its application and use. That way we know what and why we are learning a particular lesson and then focus on where it can be applied. This helps understand topics deeper and remember for a long time.

I will also try to provide visuals along with code snippets and I hope to publish two topics every week and be done with Python in the first quarter. 

I know this is slow, but, this is all the time I got. Follow my blog topics in the following order. (Some may not exist as I haven't blogged them yet)
